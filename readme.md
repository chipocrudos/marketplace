# Marketplace for freelancers

A user can login to the site and create a job request with some basic information (title, description, budget). Freelancers are able to see all the job requests. They can view a detail page of each job request, and accept the job if it hasn't been accepted yet. Once accepted they will then be able to confirm when the job is done.
